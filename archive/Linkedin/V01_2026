3) About
Hi, I’m Harsh — a passionate Android & Flutter Developer, actively seeking full-time Android SDE opportunities.

With a strong foundation in Computer Engineering (B.E. 2025, Mumbai University) and hands-on experience building production-grade Android apps, I specialize in developing modern, scalable, and user-focused mobile applications.

I love turning ideas into impactful software using Java, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Flutter. I’ve built apps like CineLayr, NewsRoom, and VoteChain, taking them end-to-end — covering UI, architecture, networking, caching, background tasks, testing, performance benchmarking, and CI/CD.

🚀 Currently:
- Enhancing my expertise in Android internals, app architecture patterns, and emerging development trends.
- Deepening my knowledge in system design, scalable app development, and performance optimization to build high-quality software.

💼 What I Bring:
- Real-world, production-level Android experience — with multiple apps on GitHub.
- Strong CS fundamentals: OOP, DSA, OS, DBMS, Networking, and Design Principles.
- A problem-solving mindset focused on building software that solves real-world problems.
- Adaptable and fast learner, mastering modern Android development while growing into increasingly responsible technical roles.
